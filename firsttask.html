    The HTML5 structure provided creates a simple, well-organized webpage layout using semantic tags. At the top, the `header` contains a main heading (`h1`) titled "Welcome to My Website" and a navigation menu using the `nav` tag, which includes two links: "Home" and "About". These links are part of an unordered list (`ul`), each represented by a list item (`li`) containing an anchor (`a`) element. The main content of the page is wrapped inside the `main` tag, which includes two sections defined using the `section` tag. The first section, labeled "Home", contains a heading (`h2`) and a paragraph introducing the homepage. The second section, "About", also has a heading and a paragraph that provides information about the site. At the bottom of the page, the `footer` displays a copyright notice. Overall, this HTML5 structure ensures content is logically grouped and easy to read both for users and search engines, making it an ideal foundation for any modern webpage.
